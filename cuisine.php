           <h1>Golbari</h1>
           Kolkata is incomplete without its North Kolkata charm, which brings me to my next place. For generations on end, Golbari and Kosha Mangsho have been synonymous. What’s so exquisite about this place is that even after 94 years of running, it has never changed its -. This places once known as the New Punjabi restaurant is now colloquially been renamed to Golbari for its spherical facade ( ‘gol’ meaning circle in Bengali). What most people do not know about this place is that Golbari famous for serving Bengali delicacies like Kosha Mangsho was started by a Punjabi and not a Bengali. If you are in Kolkata, your trip won’t be worthwhile until you try the soft mutton cooked in the dark velvety texture of gravy otherwise popularly known as Kosha Mangsho. And mind you, they have no branches!
